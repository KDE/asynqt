AsynQt is licensed under LGPL 2 or later.

It is most likely that LGPL 3 is the one that will suit everyone the most,
except projects that use GPL 2.

Since AsynQt is a header-only library, LGPL 2 might be problematic
due to its viral effect. This problem is fixed in LGPL 3 which
allows using LGPL3 header-only libraries in closed-source projects.
